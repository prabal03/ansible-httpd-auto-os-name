# ansible-httpd-auto-os-name

Hello Guys  Welcome you all again

In this project of ansible I have made a playbook that will retrive the os name automatically and according to that it will install the package and start the service 

 For Example :
 
 Suppose 192.168.32.34 is of redhat version 8 and it support httpd image so my playbook will first see the os name then acc to that it will install the package so here playbook will install httpd image
